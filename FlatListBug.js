This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and the keyExtractor prop is not properly set.  The error message might be cryptic or even absent, manifesting as seemingly random rendering issues, slow scrolling, or incorrect item display. This is because React Native needs a unique key for each item to efficiently manage the list, and without it, it struggles to track changes and update the UI correctly.
